Recipe breakdown is a simple app who's main goal is to take search terms (ingredients, cuisine types) and return a list of recipes from the edamam recipe api. Upon selection of a recipe, you will be shown the ingredients, calories, nutrition facts and a link to the recipe page and directions. This app is useful to quickly browse for recipes based on ingredients you may have and don't know what to do with.

![home page](./resources/home-page.jpg)

This is the home page where users can put in a search term and press the submit button to send their input to the api

![response page](./resources/recipe-list.jpg)

The response page will present you with a list of responses including the title of the recipe, a photo of the recipe and a button to show you more details

![recipe details](./resources/recipe-source.jpg)
![ingredient list](./resources/ingredient-list.jpg)
![nutrient list](./resources/nutrient-list.jpg)

Upon click of the button for recipe details you will see the title, the same image, the source of the recipe, the calories, an ingredient list, general nutrition information and a link to view the recipe directions on the original page.
