Recipe breakdown is a simple app who's main goal is to take search terms (ingredients, cuisine types) and return a list of recipes from the edamam recipe api. Upon selection of a recipe, you will be shown the ingredients, calories, nutrition facts and a link to the recipe page and directions. This app is useful to quickly browse for recipes based on ingredients you may have and don't know what to do with.
